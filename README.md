# Snakemake k-mer
## Description
Use of Snakemake workflow management system along with k-mer algorithm.

K-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence. Primarily used within the context of computational genomics and sequence analysis, in which k-mers are composed of nucleotides (i.e. A, T, G, and C), k-mers are capitalized upon to assemble DNA sequences, improve heterologous gene expression, identify species in metagenomic samples, and create attenuated vaccines. A method of visualizing k-mers, the k-mer spectrum, shows the multiplicity of each k-mer in a sequence versus the number of k-mers with that multiplicity.

## Requirements
Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:  
  * You have installed the python libraries:
