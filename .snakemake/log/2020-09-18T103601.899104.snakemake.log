Job 3: Best kmer search

Error in rule best_fit:
    jobid: 3
    output: result.txt
    shell:
        
			python best-fit.py result.txt files/complete_genome_SARS-CoV-2.fasta 
			
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job best_fit since they might be corrupted:
result.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
